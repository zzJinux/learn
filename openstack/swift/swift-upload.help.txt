Usage: swift upload [--changed] [--skip-identical] [--segment-size <size>]
                    [--segment-container <container>] [--leave-segments]
                    [--object-threads <thread>] [--segment-threads <threads>]
                    [--meta <name:value>] [--header <header>] [--use-slo]
                    [--use-dlo] [--ignore-checksum] [--skip-container-put]
                    [--object-name <object-name>]
                    <container> <file_or_directory> [<file_or_directory>] [...]

Uploads specified files and directories to the given container.

Positional arguments:
  <container>           Name of container to upload to.
  <file_or_directory>   Name of file or directory to upload. Specify multiple
                        times for multiple uploads. If "-" is specified, reads
                        content from standard input (--object-name is required
                        in this case).

Optional arguments:
  -c, --changed         Only upload files that have changed since the last
                        upload.
  --skip-identical      Skip uploading files that are identical on both sides.
  -S, --segment-size <size>
                        Upload files in segments no larger than <size> (in
                        Bytes) and then create a "manifest" file that will
                        download all the segments as if it were the original
                        file.
  --segment-container <container>
                        Upload the segments into the specified container. If
                        not specified, the segments will be uploaded to a
                        <container>_segments container to not pollute the
                        main <container> listings.
  --leave-segments      Indicates that you want the older segments of manifest
                        objects left alone (in the case of overwrites).
  --object-threads <threads>
                        Number of threads to use for uploading full objects.
                        Default is 10.
  --segment-threads <threads>
                        Number of threads to use for uploading object segments.
                        Default is 10.
  -m, --meta <name:value>
                        Sets a meta data item. This option may be repeated.
                        Example: -m Color:Blue -m Size:Large
  -H, --header <header:value>
                        Adds a customized request header. This option may be
                        repeated. Example: -H "content-type:text/plain"
                         -H "Content-Length: 4000".
  --use-slo             When used in conjunction with --segment-size it will
                        create a Static Large Object. Deprecated; this is now
                        the default behavior when the cluster supports it.
  --use-dlo             When used in conjunction with --segment-size it will
                        create a Dynamic Large Object. May be useful with old
                        swift clusters.
  --ignore-checksum     Turn off checksum validation for uploads.
  --skip-container-put  Assume all necessary containers already exist; don't
                        automatically try to create them.
  --object-name <object-name>
                        Upload file and name object to <object-name> or upload
                        dir and use <object-name> as object prefix instead of
                        folder name.
